Uber is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an account in January 2014 was provided. The goal is to use this data set to help understand what factors are the best predictors for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Uber.

The work flows are as follow:
1. Perform any cleaning, exploratory analysis, and/or visualizations to use the provided data for this analysis. 
2. Build a predictive model to help determine whether or not a user will be retained.
3. Evaluate the model
4. Identify / interpret features that are the most influential in affecting your predictions
